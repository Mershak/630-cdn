# Mert Yapucuoglu, CS630 Distributed Systems Final Project

This is a CDN implementation/simulation project to understand and develop step-by-step a CDN from ground up. Each phase contains the code and Dockerfile needed to manage a component in the CDN system.

## To run
 - You must have Docker and docker-compose installed
 - `cd phase1`, to cd in the phase you want to run. 
 - `docker-compose up --build`, to run the containers and let the simulation run

At the end of each run, statistics will be shown, and a results csv file will be added to the /phaseX/results folder.
